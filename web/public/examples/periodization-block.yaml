glossary:
  "Block Periodization": "Training approach organizing focused training blocks with specific adaptations"
  "Hypertrophy Block": "High volume, moderate intensity block focused on muscle growth"
  "Strength Block": "Moderate volume, high intensity block focused on maximal strength"
  "Power Block": "Low volume, explosive work focused on rate of force development"
  "Mesocycle": "3-4 week training block with a specific focus"

cycle:
  notes: "3 distinct mesocycles. Block 1 (Weeks 1-3): Hypertrophy focus - build muscle and work capacity. Block 2 (Weeks 4-6): Strength focus - convert size to strength. Block 3 (Weeks 7-9): Power/Peaking - maximize force production and prepare for competition."
