glossary:
  "Linear Periodization": "Training methodology where volume decreases and intensity increases progressively over time"
  "Accumulation": "Phase focused on building work capacity through higher volume at moderate intensity"
  "Intensification": "Phase focused on building maximal strength through lower volume at high intensity"
  "Taper": "Reduction in training volume to allow for recovery and peak performance"

cycle:
  notes: "12-week linear periodization. Weeks 1-4: Accumulation (higher volume, moderate intensity). Weeks 5-8: Transition (moderate volume, higher intensity). Weeks 9-11: Intensification (low volume, high intensity). Week 12: Deload/Taper."
