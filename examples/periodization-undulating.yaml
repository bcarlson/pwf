glossary:
  "DUP": "Daily Undulating Periodization - varying intensity and volume across training sessions within the same week"
  "Power Day": "Low reps (1-3), high intensity (85-95% 1RM), focus on speed and explosiveness"
  "Strength Day": "Moderate reps (4-6), moderate-high intensity (75-85% 1RM), traditional strength work"
  "Hypertrophy Day": "High reps (8-12), moderate intensity (65-75% 1RM), muscle building"
  "Undulating": "Wave-like progression varying training stress within weekly microcycles"

cycle:
  notes: "8-week DUP program. Each week follows the same pattern: Day 1 (Power), Day 2 (Strength), Day 3 (Hypertrophy). Intensity increases every 2 weeks within each rep range. Week 4 and 8 are deload weeks."
